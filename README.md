# Missile Command w/ ncurses

In order for the game to be compiled, you need to copy the repo in Cygwin terminal preferrably as it is in support of ncurses.
Then you need to do in the terminal make in the directory created along with the src code and the other folders. Then do ./target/Missile_command-C
Enjoy!
